# Code Description

This folder contains all code used to support the analysis presented in the paper:

**"Analysis of Carbon Capture Strategies for Refineries Considering Extraordinary Future Economic and Policy Uncertainties"**

The scripts in this folder were used to process input data, run simulations (e.g., real options modeling, carbon capture cost estimation), and generate the figures and tables included in both the main manuscript and Supplementary Information.
